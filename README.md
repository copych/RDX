# RDX
This is an ESP32S3 approximation of a known FM synth. I don't have the real one, so it's a kind of a self-set challenge. It has a lot of 'AS IS', and mostly consists of compromises.
Yet, by default it's a USB-MIDI device that one can use with some midi host. It understands almost every documented midi feature, though I don't know how the original behaves.
It has 7-8 notes polyphony, 4 operators and 2 effects in a chain.
The code is written from scratch, but has a lot of AI generated pieces. Otherwise it'd take me forever to get at this point.
